</p>
<p>
First, we open the Start Menu and open up the Control Panel. From there we select "Programs" then "Turn Windows Features On or Off". In this window we want to tick the box next to Internet Information Services. In the drop down menu, under World Wide Web Services and Application Development Features, make sure CGI is checked.

Also, make sure that Common HTTP Features is selected and, under Web Management Tools, IIS Management console is selected as well.

These two are pretty self explanatory. There is no need for any special configuration or install instructions though, as a precaution, it should be noted that installing these on your default directory (usually the C: drive) is probably best.

<p>
Next we want to download the files for the PHP and extract them from the ZIP file. I would recommend creating a folder on your default directory and extracting the files into that folder. My PHP folder is on my C drive, as seen here.
